# EcoSort-AI-Waste-Segregation
Prompt-based Al assistant for waste segregation &amp; recycling guidance (SDG 12).

EcoSort AI – Waste Segregation & Recycling Assistant 🌍♻️
Primary SDG: SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production

📌 Project Overview
EcoSort AI is a prompt-based AI assistant designed to help users correctly segregate waste and follow safe disposal and recycling methods.
It provides clear guidance to reduce landfill waste, improve recycling, and promote sustainable consumption.

🎯 Problem Statement
In many households, colleges, and public places, waste is often mixed due to lack of awareness about segregation rules.
Mixing wet waste, plastic waste, e-waste, and hazardous waste leads to:
poor recycling
increased landfill pollution
harmful effects on environment and animals
This project aims to use AI to guide users in waste classification and correct disposal.

✅ Proposed Solution
EcoSort AI acts like a chatbot assistant.
The user enters a waste item name (single item or multiple items), and the AI provides:
Waste category (Wet / Dry / Recyclable / Hazardous / E-waste)
Bin recommendation (Green / Blue / Red)
Safe disposal steps
Recycling and reuse suggestions
Environmental impact if disposed incorrectly
Safety warning for hazardous items

🤖 AI Elements & Tools Used
This project is created using Prompt Engineering (no heavy coding required).

✅ AI Components Used
Prompt Engineering
Entity Extraction (detecting waste items from user input)
Summarization (short and clear guidance)
Agentic Workflow (classification → safety check → recommendations)

✅ Tools Used
ChatGPT (Prompt-based prototype)
GitHub (documentation + prototype storage)
Canva / PowerPoint (flowchart prototype)
Mobile screenshots / screen recording (prototype evidence)

🧩 Workflow / Flowchart (Prototype)
Start → User inputs waste item → AI extracts items → AI classifies waste →
AI suggests bin + disposal steps → User disposes correctly → Reduced pollution → End

🧪 Prompt Prototype (Master Prompt)
Use the following prompt to run EcoSort AI:
MASTER PROMPT: You are EcoSort AI, a waste segregation and recycling assistant.
When the user enters a waste item (or list of items), do the following:
Extract the waste item names (entities)
Classify each item into: Wet / Organic, Dry, Recyclable, Hazardous, E-waste
Suggest correct bin: Green / Blue / Red
Give safe disposal steps
Give recycling tips
Warn if it is harmful
Keep your answer clear and student-friendly.
Output format:
✅ Items detected:
✅ Category:
✅ Bin:
✅ How to dispose:
✅ Recycling tip:
⚠️ Safety note:

✅ Sample Test Inputs (For Demo)
Use these inputs and capture screenshots:
Plastic bottle
Banana peel
Used battery
Old newspaper
Glass bottle
Food leftovers
Broken mobile phone
Medicine strip
Aluminium can
Used mask

🛡️ Responsible AI Considerations
EcoSort AI is designed with responsible AI principles:
Privacy: No personal user data is collected
Transparency: Clear explanation for classification and disposal steps
Safety: Special warnings for hazardous/e-waste items
Sustainability: Encourages recycling, reuse, and safe disposal behavior

🌱 Expected Impact
Improves awareness of correct waste segregation
Supports responsible consumption habits
Increases recycling and reduces landfill waste
Promotes cleaner campus/city environment
Helps reduce pollution and protect animals and nature

📷 Prototype Evidence (Screenshots / Video)
Screenshots of AI outputs and flowchart are added in the repository.
(Upload your screenshots into a folder named screenshots/)

📌 Future Enhancement (Multimodal AI)
In future, EcoSort AI can be upgraded to accept:
Image input (photo of waste item)
Document input (municipal waste rules PDF)
This will make the assistant more accurate and easier to use.
